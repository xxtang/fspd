<h4><a name="1.1">Q.1.1 What's alt.comp.fsp? What's fsp?</a></h4>

<p>Alt.comp.fsp is a Usenet newsgroup for discussing the FSP file
transmission protocol. It was created on Tuesday 4th May 1993 by
Wen-King Su (wen-king@cs.caltech.edu) after there was no
objection on alt.config. Before the newsgroup, there was a
mailing list (fsp-discussion) for talking about FSP software
internals. This newsgroup is for discussion of both writing and
using the software. </p>

<p>FSP is a protocol, a bit like FTP (but see below), for moving
files around. It's designed for anonymous archives, and has
protection against server and network overloading. It doesn't use
connections, so it can survive things falling over. </p>

to make it run on VMS. Larkin Lowrey wrote the OS/2 version,
Lindsey Smith wrote the MS-DOS version and Garrick Lau wrote the
Windows-95/NT version. Email addresses are in <a href="#4">Section

<h4><a name="1.3">Q.1.3 Help! I don't understand how to use FSP!</a></h4>

<p>If you're already familiar with FTP, you might want to use one
of the FTP-like clients instead, or even a graphical interface.
See the answers to questions <a href="#2.1">2.1</a> and <a
href="#2.2">2.2</a> below for details of how to get them. </p>

<p>The following tutorial is adapted from an article in
alt.comp.fsp by David DeSimone (fox@netcom.com). </p>

<p>The original FSP seems to have been designed for use with csh
aliases, so if you use csh, try these aliases in your .cshrc: </p>

<pre>	# FSP aliases:
	alias fcat   '(set noglob; exec fcatcmd \!*)'
	alias fcd    'setenv FSP_DIR `(set noglob; exec fcdcmd \!*)`'
	alias fget   '(set noglob; exec fgetcmd \!*)'
	alias fgrab  '(set noglob; exec fgrabcmd \!*)'
	alias fls    '(set noglob; exec flscmd -F \!*)'
	alias fll    '(set noglob; exec flscmd -l \!*)'
	alias fpro   '(set noglob; exec fprocmd \!*)'
	alias fpwd   'echo &quot;$FSP_HOST ($FSP_PORT): $FSP_DIR&quot;'
	alias frm    '(set noglob; exec frmcmd \!*)'
	alias frmdir '(set noglob; exec frmdircmd \!*)'
	alias fhost  'set fsp_host=(\!*); source ~/bin/fhost; unset fsp_host'
</pre>

<p>The last alias, &quot;fhost&quot;, is my own invention, and
the ~/bin/fhost file looks like this: </p>

<pre>	#!/bin/csh
	#
	# Since this script sets environment variables, it really needs
	# to be source'd rather than executed.  Thus the following alias
	# should be used:
	#
	# alias fhost 'set fsp_host=(\!*); source ~/.bin/fhost; unset fsp_host'
	#
 
	if ( $#fsp_host &gt; 0 ) then

	    setenv FSP_HOST $fsp_host[1]

	    if ( $#fsp_host &gt; 1 ) then
		setenv FSP_PORT $fsp_host[2]
	    else
		setenv FSP_PORT 21
	    endif

	    if ( $#fsp_host &gt; 2 ) then
		setenv FSP_DIR $fsp_host[3]
	    else
		setenv FSP_DIR /
	    endif

	endif

	if ( $?FSP_HOST ) then
	    echo &quot;$FSP_HOST ($FSP_PORT): $FSP_DIR&quot;
	endif
</pre>

<p>This alias lets you &quot;connect&quot; to a host quickly and
easily. For instance, to start out I give the following command: </p>

<pre>	<kbd>% fhost wuarchive.wustl.edu</kbd>
	<samp>wuarchive.wustl.edu (21):</samp>
</pre>

<p>The &quot;fhost&quot; command tells me where I'm connected, on
what port, and in what directory. </p>

<p>Since all &quot;fhost&quot; does is set up some environment
variables, we aren't REALLY connected. To find out if the site is
responding, just do a quick &quot;fls&quot;: </p>

<pre>	<kbd>% fls</kbd>
	<samp>README          etc/            mirrors2/       pub/
	README.NFS      graphics/       mirrors3/       systems/
	edu/            mirrors/        private/</samp>
</pre>

<p>Looks like we're up and running! Navigating with FSP is now
just like using the local filesystem, except the commands have
&quot;f&quot; in front of them. For instance: </p>

<pre>	<kbd>% fcd /systems/amiga/incoming</kbd>
	<samp>directory mode: (owner: some other machine)(delete: NO)(create: NO)</samp>
	<kbd>% fls</kbd>
        <samp>AT3D-Demo.bad       devel/              utils/
        AT3D-Demo.readme    fish/               wb30/
        comm/               programming/        demos/
        text/</samp>
</pre>

<p>Other nice commands like &quot;fcat filename&quot; let me see
what's out there, or for larger files, &quot;fcat filename |
less&quot; is very effective. </p>

<p>Once I see a nice file that I want copied to my local system,
I just give the &quot;fget filename&quot; command and away it
goes. Usually I type &quot;fget filename &amp;&quot; which throws
the transfer request into the background. Then I can immediately
go off and &quot;fcd&quot; to some other directory and look for
more files to grab, &quot;fcat&quot;-ing the README files and
such. </p>

<p> </p>

<hr>

<h4><a name="1.4">Q.1.4 What are those funny &quot;R&quot; and
&quot;I&quot; characters?</a></h4>

<p> </p>

<p>When FSP doesn't get any response from the server, it keeps on
sending requests. The first time it retries, it prints an
&quot;R&quot;, (meaning &quot;Retry&quot;), and the second,
third, and subsequent times, it prints an &quot;I&quot;. You
might also see an &quot;E&quot;, which means &quot;error&quot;:
FSP got a packet, but it was corrupted for some reason. </p>

<p>Fspclient does it slightly differently: it starts by printing
&quot;r&quot; and &quot;R&quot; characters, and then uses
&quot;-\|/&quot; characters to draw a spinning bar. As Phil
Richards (the author) says, `I quite often see spinning bars, but
usually only after the fifth pint'. </p>

<p> </p>

<hr>

<h4><a name="1.5">Q.1.5 Why should I, as a site admin, run an FSP
daemon?</a></h4>

<p> </p>

<p>Because it's one more way people can access your site, and it
won't cost you much extra load on the machine. The FSP daemon
never forks, so it won't increase your load average by more than
one. FSP doesn't add much to the network load either, and you can
limit the amount of data the daemon will send out per second. </p>

<p>FSP allows comprehensive logging, running off inetd, README
files per directory, banning on per-host or per-network basis,
reverse naming and read-only sites. The only thing anonymous FTP
gives that FSP doesn't is having the user type in an email
address, and of course, this can easily be faked. FSP logs give
the user's hostname, which is harder to fake. </p>

<p> </p>

<hr>

<h4><a name="1.6">Q.1.6 Why do FSP clients appear to hang
sometimes ?</a></h4>

<p> </p>

<p>When unable to get a response to it's last request an FSP
client use a non-linear algorithm to increase the delay until
they re-try. Effectively this means that during a transfer a
client may appear to be sitting their doing nothing for periods
of time, as the timeout in use increases to high values, to
paraphrase Wen-King Su - &quot;the algorithm is brain
damaged&quot;. This problem has been addressed in the next
release of FSP (in beta testing). </p>

<h3><a name="2">Section 2: FSP software and resources</a></h3>

<h4><a name="2.1">Q.2.1 Where can I get an FTP-like interface for
FSP?</a></h4>

<p> </p>

<p>Phil Richards' (pgr@sst.icl.co.uk) fspclient. The latest
version (still pre-alpha, but more reliable than your average
beta release) is fspclient.0.0-h. You can get it by FTP from </p>

<p> </p>

<ul>
    <li><a
        href="ftp://ftp.germany.eu.net/pub/networking/inet/fsp/fspclient.0.0-h+.tar.z">
        ftp://ftp.germany.eu.net/pub/networking/inet/fsp/fspclient.0.0-h+.tar.z

    <li>fsp://ftp.germany.eu.net:2001/pub/networking/inet/fsp/fspclient.0.0-h+.tar.z
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Another interface to use is Nicolai Langfeldt's 'fspcli'. It
has a ftp like interface and more. It has been posted on
alt.sources. Another nice thing about it is that it's a
small(ish) perl script rather than a large compiled executable,
and it's not alpha OR beta. Presently the latest version is 1.2.1
and is available at </p>

<h4><a name="2.5">Q.2.5 What about FSP Software Updates ?</a></h4>

<p> </p>

<p>The revision of the FSP protocol to version 3.0 is currently
on going. Forums for discussion are the alt.comp.fsp newsgroup
and the fsp-discussion@germany.eu.net mailing list. </p>

<p>Current work in progress includes an FSP RFC (Request For
Comments) - basically an internet specification of the protocol;
alterations to improve security facilities; a programmers API and
miscellanous extra features &amp; facilities. </p>

<p>In the meantime a new release (v.2.8.1 Beta 1) was released to
Beta testing in January 1996, superseding the previous 2.8.0 Beta
series. It fixes a number of portability issues, known bugs and
documentation errors. It also provides scope for backwards
compatibility with revisions to the FSP protocol which are
scheduled for FSP 2.9.0 and beyond. </p>

<p>The next scheduled release is v.2.9.0. This is intended to act
as a migratory step to 3.0. Some alternations will be made to the
client and server functionality in 2.9.0, but this release is
mainly intended to greatly simplify and tidy the code base,
bringing it up to date with ANSI C/C++ and the POSIX standards.
This release is also intended to provide a foundation for much
easier porting of the software between platforms, including
Win32/Winsock 2.0 support scheduled for inclusion in 3.0. </p>

<h3><a name="3">Section 3: Technical Issues</a></h3>

<h4><a name="3.1">Q.3.1 What are the main differences between FSP
and FTP? How does FSP work?</a></h4>

<p> </p>

<p>From the user's point of view, the differences are not that
great, except that some of the more annoying features of FTP are
gone. Here are the main differences. </p>

<p> </p>

<ul>
    <li>The protocol can stand things going down: if the server
        or the network falls over in the middle of a transfer,
        you can just wait until it comes back up. You don't have
        to reconnect, and even better, if the server went down
        90% through grabbing a file, you can continue from where
        you left off. <p> </p>
    </li>
    <li>The protocol doesn't need a username or password. You
        just throw packets at the server. You don't have to
        identify yourself (though you're not completely anonymous
        -- see below). <p> </p>
    </li>
    <li>It's harder to kill off a site with an FSP server than
        with an FTP server. The FSP daemon is designed to be as
        lightweight as possible: it doesn't fork off any
        sub-processes, and it takes steps to limit the amount of
        traffic it handles. <p> </p>
    </li>
    <li>The user interface is completely different. The interface
        that comes with the package consists of eleven commands
        that you can call from the shell. In effect, your shell
        is providing all the nice functions like command line
        editing. This makes the interface much more versatile
        than FTP's. (See below for how to get an FTP-like
        interface, though). <p> </p>
    </li>
    <li>FSP is a bit slower than FTP. This is a feature, not a
        bug. The point is to keep the communication lightweight,
        and not to flood the net. </li>
</ul>

<p>From the programmer's point of view, fsp is a complete
rewrite. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Instead of TCP sockets, it uses datagrams to communicate,
        so that the connection doesn't break on a flaky line. <p>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>FTP works by opening a port, and then asking the server
        to send a file to it. FSP uses the same port all the time
        for communication, and asks for segments of a file. So
        you can start off a transfer half way through a file, if
        you really want to. <p> </p>
    </li>
    <li>The server tries to make sure you don't ask for packets
        too quickly. Each packet it sends out has a random
        identification number, which the client must return on
        the next request. (If the client loses the number, it
        must wait a few seconds before the server accepts another
        packet from it). Therefore, the client has to wait for an
        answer to each request before it sends out the next one. </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<hr>

<h4><a name="3.2">Q.3.2 How secure/anonymous is FSP?</a></h4>

<p> </p>

<p>By default, the FSP daemon keeps logs of transactions, along
with their site names. An FSP administrator could use this to
find out who you are, with a reasonable degree of certainty. </p>

<p>In short, FSP gives you no more privacy than anonymous FTP.
Anyone who tells you different has a less devious mind than most
FSP admins I know. </p>

<p>Why not make FSP more anonymous? Well, it's impossible to make
a protocol with complete anonymity, since at some point, the
remote site will have to send a file back to you, and it needs at
least an address to send it to. </p>

<p>If you really need privacy, you can encrypt any files you make
available, and only give out the decryption password to a select
few. But of course, you have to trust them to keep the password
safe. </p>

<p> </p>

<hr>

<h4><a name="3.3">Q.3.3 Why not add passwords to FSP?</a></h4>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Thanks to Joseph Traub for the material for this section)</i>
</p>

<p> </p>

<ul>
    <li>They don't add much security. If you use one password for
        the whole site, then you might just as well set up the
        site and only tell a few people its port number. That's
        no more or less secure than using a password. Besides,
        it's easier just to set up the server only to respond to
        certain hosts. <p> </p>
    </li>
    <li>Any other password system is likely to be a big loss on
        efficiency, since you'll have to check every single
        packet. <p> </p>
    </li>
    <li>The main use of server passwords appears to be so that
        people can move pirated software around, and the authors
        don't want to add code to support that. <p> </p>
    </li>
    <li>This capability does NOT belong in FSP because it gets
        away from the concept of lightweight simple file
        transfers. </li>
</ul>

official home for FSP, the FSP software distributions and other
related packages can be found there. </p>
