How to run FSP:
	The first step in running this fine software (:) is to get it to
	compile.  Every effort on my part will be made to make this code
	compile and run on any reasonable system.  The information in this
	file CURRENTLY pertains only to Unix and probably to Cygwin users.

Building:
        FSP uses SCons software construction tool. Building was tested
	with SCons 1.2.0 and Python 2.5, but older versions will probably
	work fine. Prior to building FSP you need to download and install
	SCons from http://www.scons.org.

	Other tools needed for building FSP are GNU flex and GNU C compiler.
	They should be part of your Unix distribution but you can also 
	download and compile them yourself from http://flex.sourceforge.net/
	and http://gcc.gnu.org. Its possible to use Clang as replacement
	for GCC.

	For building optional documentation you need jade or openjade and
	DocBook DSSSL stylesheets.

	SCons is replacement for configure and make utility; there is no
	separate configuration step. Building with SCons is very similar
	to using make. Run 'scons' to compile and 'scons install' to
	install.  You can skip compile part. 'scons install' will do both
	steps then.

	SCons can take several optional switches. You must supply these
	switches to BOTH phases (compile and install) of build process.
	Most important switch is disable-timeout=yes. This option switches
	fsp clients into classic infinite retry mode which is preferred
	by people with very flaky networks.

>>	By default, the SCons will install the code in /usr/local/bin

>>	machine, I install the files under /usr/jt/bin and /usr/jt/man.
>>	To do this, I type: scons prefix=/usr/jt install

	If you get ANY errors while compiling this code (excepting warnings),
	please send me email with a complete copy of the output of scons as
	well as a copy of the config.log file.

SCons command line options:
	prefix=directory	set installation directory
	disable-timeout=yes	client utilities never timeouts
	enable-debug=yes	compile in extra debug code
	enable-lamerpack=yes	build lamer pack version of fspd
	lockprefix=directory	set directory for creating client lock files
	locking=type		set locking type, default autodetected
				type is one of none, lockf, semop, flock, shmget
	enable-maintainer-mode=yes compile with libefence debug library and
				   some extra debug information
	mandir=directory	where to install man pages. default autodetect
	sysconfdir=directory	where to look for fspd and client configuration
				files. Default prefix/etc
	without-clients=yes     dont build and install client commands
	dsssl=directory		Look for DocBook DSSSL Stylesheets there

Client utilities:
        All inter-command states are kept in these three shell environment
        variables.

            FSP_PORT            Port number of the fspd you wish to contact.
            FSP_HOST            Host name or number of the fspd.
            FSP_DIR             Your current working directory in the archive.

        When multiple client utilities are run at the same time on the
        same client machine, packet multiplexing mechanisms can be used
        to enable concurrent access to the same fsp database.  If none
        of the mechanisms are selected at compile time, FSP_LOCALPORT
        can be used to ensure that only once client utility can run at
        any time.  In this case, FSP_LOCALPORT can be set to any port
        number not current used on the client machine.

        FSP_TRACE can be set if you want status reports be printed while
        files are being transferred.

	FSP_DELAY variable can be used to set the retransmit interval for
	client utilities (in thousandth of a second). This value should be
	set to slightly higher than average round trip time.  The retransmit
	rate is adjusted in an exponential manner, until the retry rate
	reaches FSP_MAXDELAY msec per retry.  This delay cannot be set
	below 250 msecs.

        FSP_BUF_SIZE can be set to a positive number less than or equal
        to 1024.  When set, it determines the size of data to be send for
        each request during file and directory information transfer.  The
        default is 1024.  Some sites are connected via links that cannot
        transmit buffers containing 1024 bytes of data in addition to the
        header information.  Setting FSP_BUF_SIZE to a lower value will
        allow these sites to access fsp archives. Large values can provide
	faster transfers.

        FSP_LOCAL_DIR can be set to a local working directory from/to which
        all data will be transferred.

Server Administration:
	IMPORTANT NOTE: You do not need to run the fspd process if you only
	wish to access existing fsp archives.  FSPD is only needed if you 
	wish to set up and maintain a new archive for use.

        fspd can run independently or it can be run under inetd.  When
        running independently, fspd waits for messages through a UDP
        socket whoes port number is defined in the fspd.conf file. 
	When runing under inetd, fspd is invoked as in.fspd.  Inetd will
	spawn fspd when a message arrives for the FSP socket.  The fspd
	process will take over and stick around to wait on additional
	messages.  After 5 minutes pass with no messages, fspd will exit
	and return control to inted.

        Sample setup for inetd operation:

          In /etc/services file:

            fsp             21/udp          fspd

          In /etc/inetd.conf file:

            fsp dgram   udp wait ftp /usr/local/bin/fspd in.fspd

          In this sample, the same port number for ftp is used for the
          fsp socket.  There will not be a conflict because ftp uses
          stream protocol, and fsp uses UDP protocol.  The fspd program
          in this example is ran under user 'ftp'.

	Many other options controlling the behavior of fspd can be set in
	the fspd.conf file.  Please read the comments in the fspd.conf
	file for details.

        Clients do not get to read the directory information directly.
        Instead, fspd maintains a directory listing for each directory
        in a cache file.  If the directory is writable by fspd, or if a
        writable file in it is prepared beforehand, fspd will store the
        directory information in .FSP_CONTENT file in that directory.

        When a client requests information for a directory, the cache
        file is created if it doesn't exist, and it is rebuilt if it is
        out of date.  The information is accessed by having the client
        read the directory listing file. Care is taken so that the client
        will not get corrupted entries when the directory is changed while
        the listing is being read.

        Files being uploaded are first written to a temporary file in the
        work directory: .TXXXXXXXXYYYY where XXXXXXXX is the inet number
        of the client, and YYYY is the port number of the client program.
        When upload is compelete, the file is moved into the intended
        location.

        Sending it an 'alarm' signal will cause fspd to dump its current
        client database into the file .HTAB_DUMP in the work directory.
        This can be useful for debugging and for catching rogue clients.
