# This is an example fspd.conf file.  Copy it and edit it to suit your tastes.
# Where you see a # in front of a configuration value it indicates that the
# value is commented out, (e.g. # conf .fspd.conf below). The text accompanying
# the entry will indicate what the value defaults to if it is commented out.

# The 'port' command specifies which port the fspd server is to listen too
# This is NOT needed if running under inetd, but otherwise is required.
# Standard port for FSP is 21, other popular ports are 2001 and 2000.
# Please run official FSP sites on port 21.
#
# If you want a random port from 1024 - 65535 range, set port to 65535
#
# ================================================================
# If you want to avoid detection by lamer security scanner nessus
# do not use ports: 21, 2000 and 2221.

# Server can listen only on particular network interface
#listenaddress 192.168.1.2

# The 'packetsize' sets maximal data size which will send FSPD in one packet.
# FSP definition allows up to 1024 bytes of data (default value) and it is a
# recommended to use this value unless there is a reason to use a smaller one.
# If your FSP site eats too much bandwidth try smaller value.
#
# You could try larger values. All networks are required to transfer 500 bytes
# long UDP packets. Almost all networks today works with 1300 and most with
# 1400. On Ethernet you can go to 1460.  Larger values are possible, but FSP
# packet will be split into 2 or more IP packets which lowers reliability of
# file transfers but you can get some speed gain. 
#
# Packets > 1024 bytes are never send out unless client requests them.
# 12 byte long FSP header size is not included in packetsize.
#
# !!! If you change this value in 64-1024 range you must delete all prebuilded
# directory listings stored in .FSP_CONTENT files !!!

# packetsize 768

# The 'conf' command allows a global file to read local files so that
# multiple users at a site can use the same central fspd file.
#
# conf .fspd.conf

# The 'homedir' command tells the server where it's ROOT directory is. 
# This directory must be given as an absolute path.
#
#homedir /usr/fsp/data
 homedir /home/xxfan/fsp
# 'homedir_restricted' off can allow symlinks which goes out of home
# directory.
homedir_restricted off

# 'use_access_files' if server should check for special .FSP files
# in directory and set access rights according to that.
# In most installation, yes is right. Use `no` if people can upload
# files starting with .FSP into fsp server homedir.
use_access_files yes

# 'permit_passwordless_owners' If server allow directory owners without
# any password only based on request IP. Because IP can be easily spoofed,
# it is recommended to require a password.
permit_passwordless_owners off

# The 'tmpdir' command controls where the server stores temporary files
# during upload or grab. You must have it or server will support
# read operations only. This can be absolute or relative path to home
# dir. Server will try to create it.
#
tmpdir /tmp/fsp

# The 'pidlogname command controls where we write the fspd pid.
#pidlogname /var/run/fspd.pid
pidlogname /tmp/fspd.pid
# The 'grabcommand' can turn grab command on or off.
grabcommand on

# The 'vercommand' can turn fver command on or off. All known FSP scanners
# are using this command for detection of FSP server presence.
# vercommand must be disabled for stealth operation. Yes, lamers sucks.
vercommand on

# The 'readme' commands specifies the name of the local readme file
# for each directory.  If no readme command is given, the readme file
# defaults to .README
#
# readme .README

# The 'dircache' command controls how much directories listings gets cached.
dircache 100

# 'use_prebuild_dirlists' allows to load/save prebuilded directories
# listing from filesystem. It is a good idea to allow that, because it
# helps server performance. Disable it only if you dislike .FSP_CONTENT
# file in every directory.
# Do not use on Win32 system!
#use_prebuild_dirlists yes

# The 'statcache' command controls how many directories are placed into
# stat cache. Cache contains last modified time and access rights.
statcache 30

# The 'statcache_timeout' command controls how long statcache entries are
# valid before directory gets re-examined by stat()
statcache_timeout 20

# 'use_directory_mtime'. If your filesystem changes mtime when directory
# is updated, set it to YES. If set to NO, directory will be rechecked
# after statcache_timeout and dircache entry invalidated.
# Do not use on Win32 system.
#use_directory_mtime yes

# The 'filecache' command controls maximal number of open files by server.
# After this limit will be reached, server will close last recently used files.
# This do not prevent any number clients from downloading, but file for each
# request must be opened first. Setting this lowers open/close overhead.
filecache 30

# The 'dumpfile' command tells the server where to log stats on SIGUSR1
# signal.
# It can be a relative path from the fspd home directory or an absolute
# path. it must include the filename.
dumpfile /tmp/fspd.stats

# The 'logfile' command tells the server where to log things if
# logging is enabled.
# It can be a relative path from the fspd home directory or an absolute
# path.
# it must include the filename.
#
#logfile ../logs/logfile
logfile /tmp/fsp.log
# The 'log' command specifies the type of logging that should be performed.
# The log command takes the following options
# 'none' or any of 'all', '(!)errors', '(!)version', '(!)getdir',
# '(!)getfile', '(!)upload', '(!)install', '(!)delfile', '(!)deldir',
# '(!)setpro', '(!)getpro', '(!)makedir', '(!)grabfile',(!)readonly,
# '(!)stat', '(!)rename'.
# logging of 'all' will include logging of errors.
# for example:
# log all !errors -- will log all commands sent, but no error messages.
# log all !getdir -- will log all commands except getdir and all errors
#                    EXCEPT those that occurred on a getdir command.
# log install getfile errors -- will log all install and getfile commands
#                    as well as any errors that occur on ONLY those commands.
# If no log command is given, logging will be turned of (same as 'log none')
#
log all !readonly

#The 'xferlog' command tells server where to use wuftpd compatible
#transfer log file. Loging subsystem currently do not support
#recording of partial transfers.
#xferlog ../logs/xferlog
xferlog /tmp/xfsp.log
# The 'thruput' command is used to specify the maximum average
# number of bytes per second that the server will transmit. Use 
# 'thruput off' to specify no through put control. A negative value or
# zero will also shut off thruput control. If this command is not given,
# it acts like 'thruput off'
#
# thruput off

# The 'setuid' command is used to specify a specific uid under which the
# FSP server will run.  Use 'setuid off' or 'setuid 0' in order to not
# attempt to perform a setuid.  If this command is not given, it acts like
# 'setuid off'. Using setuid enables you to run the server as a specific
# user rather than as root, you may want to do this for security reasons.
# If you do this then ensure that the user id you assign to fspd has the
# necessary permissions to read and write from the directories you have
# assigned elsewhere in this configuration file.
# YOU MUST USE NUMERIC USER UID!      setuid 56
#
# setuid off

# The 'setgid' command is similar to setuid, but sets a group.
# setgid off

# The 'umask' for uploaded files. Standard octal value.
# umask 0033

# The 'serverumask' is used when creating special access files.
# serverumask 0077

# The 'daemonize' command specifies whether the fspd should fork itself into
# the background when started up.  The only acceptable values are 'on' or
# 'off'.  If this command isn't given, it acts like 'daemonize on'.
#
# daemonize on

# The 'debug' command specifies whether the server should write debugging
# output to stderr while it is running. The only acceptable values are 'on'
# or 'off'.  If this command is never given, it acts like 'debug off'.
#
 debug off
# debug on
# The 'restricted' command specifies whether the server is run in restricted
# mode.  In this case, only hosts enabled via the 'host' command will be 
# able to connect.  The only acceptable values for this command are 'on' or
# 'off'.  If the command isn't given, it acts as 'restricted off'.
#
# restricted off

# The 'reverse_name' command specifies whether the server should refuse
# connections to sites that it cannot reverse lookup, that is it cannot
# turn the dotted decimal address (1.2.3.4) into a name (a.b.com). The
# only acceptable values for this command are 'on' or 'off'.  If the
# command is not given, it acts like 'reverse_name off' by default.
#
# reverse_name off

# The 'read_only' command specifies whether the server should ignore any 
# commands that would cause a 'write' action on the server.  The commands
# that are refused by this are upload, install, mkdir, deldir, delfile, 
# and setpro.  The only acceptable values for this command are 'on' or 'off'.
# If the command is not given, it acts like 'read_only off'.
#
# read_only off

# The "host" command can be used to grant or restrict access on a per host
# or per group of host basis. You can configure the server to either ignore
# particular clients, treat them as normal, or to always return a particular
# message to those hosts. Each host configuration line looks as follows:
#
#   host host_mask [host_type message]
#
# host_mask is either the full numeric or text name of a machine OR
# a wildcarded host mask. Wildcarded hostmasks look as follows:
#
#   128.4.*.*-128.8.*.* -- (* acts as the range 0 - 255)
#
# The above line would affect all hosts of the form 128.4.*.*, 128.5.*.*,
# 128.6.*.*, 128.7.*.* and 128.8.*.*.
#
# Host masking is only available with numeric hosts, not with text names.
#
# host_type is one of D, I, or N :
#   I hosts are ignored
#   N hosts are treated as normal
#   D hosts will receive the error string message given as the third parameter
#
# If host_type isn't specified, the host is treated as ignored or normal
# depending on the value of restricted.
#
# The following line allows all RDG machines (134.225.*.*) access to a site:
#
#   host 134.225.*.* N
#
# ... while the following would ignore all hosts from RDG:
#
#   host 134.225.*.* I
#
# ... and the following would return an error message to them all:
#
#   host 134.225.*.* D Sorry You Cannot Access This Site

# The "retry" command specifies time in sec, how much time must
# pass after new packet with the old KEY from client will be accepted
# FSP protocol definition says that must be at least 3 secs, but you
# can set this to shorter time and allow faster error recovery. It is
# highly recommended to keep it at least 3 seconds.
# retry 3

# The "timeout" command specifies how much time must pass after new
# packet with wrong KEY number is accepted. FSP definition sets this
# to 60 seconds. You can set it to lower value for faster clients
# recovery (about 20 sec is fine).

# timeout 60
